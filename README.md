just for fun

Hi, 
  This is OLDOLDMAX. I am learning github. And I wanna learn how to write a simple OS. Hope it is not very hard for me. I am too old to learn new things. But i don't like my monotonous life in nowadays.
  
  but actually i had a new job. It is not for OS, but for web app. So now i am learning java and javascript. but I'm still tring my best effort. I love coding. Let's see what i am going to be.
